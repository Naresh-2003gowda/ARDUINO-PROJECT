# ARDUINO-PROJECT

This project explores an intelligent and automated approach to waste management, leveraging modern technologies to enhance efficiency, sustainability, and environmental responsibility. Traditional waste management systems often rely on manual segregation, inefficient collection schedules, and inadequate real-time monitoring, leading to increased pollution and operational inefficiencies.

Our Smart Waste Management System integrates automated segregation and real-time monitoring to optimize waste processing. It employs sensor-based classification, IoT-enabled monitoring, and AI-driven decision-making to streamline waste collection, reduce human intervention, and ensure proper disposal of recyclable and non-recyclable materials.
